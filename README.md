## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**  
  Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- **Git**  
  Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

You can check if these are installed by running in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
git --version
```

### Step 1: Clone the repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AKAJellyBean/Explorer.git
cd Explorer
```

### Step 2: (Optional) Create a virtual environment
Itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:
  On Windows:
    
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
  On macOS/Linux:
    
    source venv/bin/activate
    

### Step 3: Install dependencies
Install required Python packages using pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Step 4: Run the game
Run the main script
```bash
python main.py
```
### Enjoy exploring the desert! :)

**Extra tips:**

- Using emojis adds some personality and easy scanning.
- The horizontal rules (`---`) visually separate steps well.
- Code blocks for commands stand out.
- Bold and italic styling helps highlight key items.

If you want, I can also help you add badges (like Python version, license, build status) at the top to make it look more professional. Would you like that?
